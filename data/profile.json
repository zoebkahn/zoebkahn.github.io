        "blurb"   : "I am a postdoctoral researcher with Jat Singh at RC-Trust at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. <p> My research explores how to enable meaningful participation in sociotechnical design. I tend to use established qualitative / design methods, but develop new methods as needed (e.g., sociotechnical visuals, storytelling). Funded by organization such as the Social Science Research Council and Center for Effective Global Action, I have engaged tech workers, homeless outreach workers, and people living in rural Togo, Malawi, Rwanda, and America on topics ranging from responsible AI (CSCW ‘25), data privacy in humanitarian aid (CSCW ‘25), rural internet access (TOCHI ‘21), and AI explainability (Blog). I hold a PhD from the UC Berkeley School of Information and a B.A. from New York University in Sociology (summa cum laude). <p>At UC Berkeley, I was co-advised by Dr. Jenna Burrell and Dr. Joshua Blumenstock, and was an AI Policy Fellow affiliated with the Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Group and Global Opportunities Lab. At NYU, I was advised by Dr. Deirdre Royster and Dr. Ruth Horowitz where my undergrad thesis explored racial inequalities in the US criminal legal system. <p>Beyond academia, I worked at an acquired tech startup, civil rights law firm, and spent four summers interning at Microsoft where I helped develop a responsible AI maturity model, tooling to support red teaming, and worked on Microsoft Copilot.",
