To inform the design of more responsible tech and tech policy, I use qualitative methods to understand the perspectives and experiences of impacted communities, and leverage storytelling to influence the design of technical systems and the policies that surround their use. My work integrates the perspectives of people with lived expertise alongside people with domain expertise (e.g., data scientists, policymaker, privacy scholars). I have conducted empirical studies in rural villages in Togo, rural ranching communities in the United States, and with people experiencing homelessness in the Bay Area.
