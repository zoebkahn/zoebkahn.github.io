I use qualitative methods to understand the perspectives and experiences of impacted communities, and leverage storytelling to influence the design of technical systems and the policies that surround their use. I have conducted empirical studies in rural villages in Togo, rural ranching communities in the United States, and with people experiencing homelessness in the Bay Area. <p> Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. summa cum laude in Sociology from NYU. Advised by <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/deirdre-royster.html'>Deirdre Royster</a> and <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/ruth-horowitz.html'>Ruth Horowitz/a>, my award-winning honorâ€™s thesis explored racial inequalities in the US criminal justice system. <p> At UC Berkeley, I am affiliated with the <a href='http://www.globalpolicy.science/'>Global Policy Lab</a>, the <a href='https://cltc.berkeley.edu/program/ai-policy-hub/'>AI Policy Hub</a>, and the <a href='https://afog.berkeley.edu/'>Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Group (AFOG)</a>. </p> <p><font color='#B7950B'>&#9733; I am on the academic job market (for tenure track positions and postdocs) in 2024-2025!</font></p>",
