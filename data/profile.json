        "blurb"   : "<p>I am a seventh year PhD Candidate at the <a href='https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/'>UC Berkeley School of Information</a> co-advised by <a href='https://jennaburrell.org/'>Jenna Burrell</a> and <a href='http://www.jblumenstock.com/'>Joshua Blumenstock</a>. <p> My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), tech policy, and ethical AI. I focus on bridging technical teams, policymakers, and individuals with lived expertise to inform the design of more just, equitable, and effective sociotechnical systems. I use qualitative methods to understand the perspectives and experiences of impacted communities, and leverage storytelling to influence the design of technical systems and the policies that surround their use. I have developed several new methods that leverage visuals and storytelling as a way to enable people, many with low literacy and limited formal education, to provide meaningful input on technical system design. I have conducted empirical studies in rural villages in Togo, rural ranching communities in the United States, with users on Tiwtter, and among tech workers at large engineering organizations. <p> I received my B.A. summa cum laude in Sociology from NYU. Advised by <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/deirdre-royster.html'>Deirdre Royster</a> and <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/ruth-horowitz.html'>Ruth Horowitz</a>, my <a href='https://cas.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/cas/documents/Inquiry_XVIII.pdf'>undergrad thesis</a> explored racial inequalities in the US criminal legal system. <p> Beyond academia, I worked at an <a href='https://www.procore.com/press/procore-to-acquire-honest-buildings-to-enhance-project-management-for-owners'> acquired tech startup</a>, <a href='https://www.rekhiwolk.com/'>plaintiff's employment law firm</a>, and spent four summers interning at Microsoft where I helped develop a <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/responsible-ai-maturity-model/'> responsible AI maturity model</a>, tooling to support red teaming, and worked on Copilot. <p>At UC Berkeley, I am affiliated with the <a href='http://www.globalpolicy.science/'>Global Policy Lab</a>, <a href='https://cltc.berkeley.edu/program/ai-policy-hub/'>AI Policy Hub</a>, and <a href='https://afog.berkeley.edu/'>Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Group (AFOG)</a>. </p> <p><font color='#B7950B'>&#9733; I am on the academic job market (for tenure track positions and postdocs) in 2024-2025!</font></p>",
